Assignment in machine learning that have two parts.
# Part 1: K-Means Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**, a core unsupervised learning technique learned in class. The algorithm is widely used for partitioning data into meaningful clusters based on similarity.

## Overview

### K-Means Algorithm
K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to divide a dataset into **K distinct clusters**. It iteratively assigns each data point to one of the clusters based on the nearest centroid and updates the centroids accordingly. The algorithm repeats this process until convergence, meaning the cluster assignments no longer change.

# part 2: PCA Implementation on MNIST Dataset

This repository contains an implementation of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** applied to the **MNIST dataset**, a popular dataset of handwritten digits. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of features in high-dimensional data while retaining as much variance as possible.

## Overview

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for dimensionality reduction by projecting data onto a lower-dimensional subspace. It finds the **principal components**, which are the directions along which the variance of the data is maximized. By reducing the number of features, PCA can simplify the dataset while preserving important patterns.
